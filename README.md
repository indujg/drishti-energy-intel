# 🛢️ DRISHTI — दृष्टि
### India's AI-Powered Energy Supply Chain Intelligence Platform

> *"India had the data. It didn't have the intelligence layer. DRISHTI is that layer."*

**ET AI Hackathon 2026 · Problem Statement #2 · Supply Chain Intelligence / Energy Security**

**[🚀 Live Demo](https://drishti-intel.vercel.app) · [📱 Mobile War Room](https://drishti-intel.vercel.app/mobile) · [📟 NFC Briefing](https://drishti-intel.vercel.app/nfc) · [📦 GitHub](https://github.com/indujg/drishti-energy-intel)**

## The Problem

India imports **88% of its crude oil**. Nearly **40–45% of that volume** transits through the Strait of Hormuz. India's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) covers only **9.5 days** of consumption.

When geopolitical shocks hit — like the 2025 US-Iran standoff that spiked Brent by 8% in a single session — India has **no real-time intelligence layer**. Decision-makers act on hours-old data. DRISHTI compresses the response from days to minutes.

## What We Built

### 🌍 Real-Time 3D War Room
- Live oil tanker tracking on a WebGL globe
- Animated shipping route arcs: Hormuz → India, Red Sea → India, Cape → India
- Indian port rings (Mumbai, Vadinar, Kochi, Vizag, Paradip)
- Click any vessel for full intelligence card

### 📈 Live Brent Crude Chart
- Animated area chart — price streams in real-time every 1.2 seconds
- Spikes dynamically when a crisis scenario is triggered
- Shows % delta from baseline

### 💥 One-Click Crisis Simulation

| Scenario | Price Impact | Transit Delay | Supply Hit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Hormuz Closure | +24.8% | +21 days | 78% |
| 🟠 Red Sea Shutdown | +12.3% | +14 days | 32% |
| 🟡 OPEC+ Emergency Cut | +18.5% | Immediate | 45% |
| ⚫ Combined Crisis | +48.2% | +35 days | 92% |

Each crisis triggers a **full-screen cinematic alert** with animated stats, then auto-opens AI procurement recommendations.

### 🤖 GPT-4o-mini Procurement Intelligence
On crisis trigger, AI instantly:
1. Scores geopolitical risk per corridor (0–100)
2. Identifies 3 alternative procurement options with viability scores
3. Ranks by cost, transit time, and geopolitical risk
4. Generates optimal SPR drawdown schedule

### 📡 Real-Time Multi-Browser Sync
- Trigger a crisis on one browser → **all connected analysts see it simultaneously**
- Powered by Supabase `postgres_changes` real-time subscriptions
- Live analyst count badge in header via Presence channels

### ▶ Demo Mode
Single click → auto-runs Hormuz Closure → Combined Crisis sequence with cinematic 3-second alert overlays.
